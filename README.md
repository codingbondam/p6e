## tips
1. simple problems you can use standard patterns and arrive at a solution and finish coding.
2. complex problems you can break down, take note of parts of the solution as you solve. and arrange them as necessary by going back to drawing board until you are confident to code.
3. hard problems, keep your discipline in thought as you try, don't give up as the scale for this problem might not be the end solution but how we iterate or attempt to solve
 
 
## patterns and tips
4. you can use an array in place of a hash map some times to keep the code simple
5. when you have two much state to maintain, a recursive function is an option if the algorithm is recursive
6. recursive algorithms might not be efficient always but could simplify the code. they are sometimes hard to build
